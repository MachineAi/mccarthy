These are slides, notes, and codes for my numerical glacier modeling lectures and projects at the International Summer School in Glaciology, McCarthy, AK.

The Summer School website is at

http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/courses/summerschool

FIXME The notes (`notes/notes-sept2014.pdf`) are suitable for printing and off-line
study.  The slides for the lectures (`slides-sept2014.pdf`) are also here.

FIXME The notes plus their exercises plus the Matlab codes form a self-contained
course.  The codes are in subdirectory `mfiles/`.  The notes and slides are
the major documentation of these programs, but they also have help files
(i.e. leading comments).  You are encouraged to actually run and modify the
codes!

This is the 2016 version.  Older versions (2010, 2012, 2014) were inside the `karthaus` repo.
