These are slides, notes, and codes on numerical glacier modeling, for the International Summer School in Glaciology, McCarthy, AK.  The Summer School website is at

http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/courses/summerschool

FIXME The slides (`FIXME.pdf`) plus their exercises plus the Matlab codes form a self-contained course.  The codes are in subdirectory FIXME`matlab/`.  The slides are the major documentation of these programs, but they also have help files (i.e. leading comments).  You are encouraged to actually run and modify the codes!

This is the 2016 version.  Older versions (2010, 2012, 2014) were inside the repo https://github.com/bueler/karthaus
