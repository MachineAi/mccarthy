These are slides, notes, and codes on numerical glacier and ice sheet modeling, for the International Summer School in Glaciology, McCarthy, AK.  The Summer School website is at

PDFs
----

The notes (`notes/notes.pdf`) plus their exercises plus the Matlab/Octave codes form a self-contained course.

The slides (`slides/lecture.pdf`) cover the same material in a more informal style.

download Matlab/Octave codes

The codes are in subdirectory `mfiles/`.  Download these codes either by cloning this repo or by getting a "release" in `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive format at

The PDFs above are the major documentation of these programs, but they also have help files (i.e. leading comments).  You are encouraged to actually run and modify the codes!
