PROJECT 7:  Ice rheology from symmetric flows
STUDENTS: XXX
ADVISOR: Ed Bueler
DESCRIPTION:  There are simple models for the evolution of circularly-symmetric flows of ice (or other viscous fluids).  This theory, used quantitatively, allows us to convert observations of real flows, whether approximately circular (polar caps on Mars) or deliberately circular (laboratory), into estimates of the rheology of the fluid.  The project will use pencil and paper calculations, some processing of data on computer, and modest experimentation.
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Matlab or Octave
REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Basic exposure to (1) differential equations and (2) Matlab or similar.


PROJECT 8: Glaciating random terrain
STUDENTS: XXX
ADVISOR: Ed Bueler
DESCRIPTION: How does glacier-covered area, or glacier volume, depend on the roughness of topography?  In this modeling project we will generate random terrain, assume altitude-accumulation feedback, model the corresponding steady states of the glaciers, and measure the modeled glaciated area and glacier volume.  How does glaciation change as equilibrium line altitude and/or lapse rates change on random terrain of different steepness?  This project will involve running laptop-suitable glacier models and processing their output.
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Python and Linux/Unix
REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Basic exposure to (1) differential equations, (2) some numerical methods, and (3) use of Python and unix-type command line.


notes to self:

project 7:   explores the methods and flow solutions used in two papers, namely Nye (2000; "A flow model for the polar caps of Mars") and Sayag and Worster (2013; "Axisymmetric gravity currents of power-law fluids over a rigid horizontal surface");  will provide those papers including data from latter; buy xanthan gum (Bobs Red Mill) and bring surgical tubing and funnel
