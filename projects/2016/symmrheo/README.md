Ice rheology from symmetric flows
---------------------------------

FIXME project 7:   explores the methods and flow solutions used in two papers, namely Nye (2000; "A flow model for the polar caps of Mars") and Sayag and Worster (2013; "Axisymmetric gravity currents of power-law fluids over a rigid horizontal surface");  will provide those papers including data from latter; buy xanthan gum (Bobs Red Mill) and bring surgical tubing and funnel

The original description:

> PROJECT 7:  Ice rheology from symmetric flows

> STUDENTS: XXX

> ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

> DESCRIPTION:  There are simple models for the evolution of circularly-symmetric flows of ice (or other viscous fluids).  This theory, used quantitatively, allows us to convert observations of real flows, whether approximately circular (polar caps on Mars) or deliberately circular (laboratory), into estimates of the rheology of the fluid.  The project will use pencil and paper calculations, some processing of data on computer, and modest experimentation.

> SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Matlab or Octave

> REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Basic exposure to (1) differential equations and (2) Matlab or similar.

needed tools

FIXME

* Any tools you need to post-process results and produce a short talk at the end of the school.

goals/mileposts
---------------

* FIXME Decide on an initial experimental design _quickly_.  That is, understand the basic idea and the basic models, and then take a guess at what to look at.

* Generate the first part of your presentation early.  I.e. slides stating the model, the parameters, the goals, and the initial experiment.  (You have to do this anyway, and doing it early helps reveal good questions early; that is the goal!)
